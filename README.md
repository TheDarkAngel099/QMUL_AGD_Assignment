# Simple Mini Game

This repository serves as a comprehensive backup of the work completed as part of my MSc Coursework in Advanced Game Development. The original repository is hosted on the QMUL Enterprise GitHub.

Throughout the course, We delved into C++ coding best practices, emphasizing the use of smart pointers and the importance of writing clean, well-organized code. We embarked on a journey from understanding the fundamentals of object-oriented programming to transitioning their codebase into a data-driven paradigm, following established game programming patterns taught in the theoretical component of the class.


## Overview

The coursework progressed through the following stages:

+Base Platform and Understanding: Initially, We were provided with foundational code and tools to commence their project.
+ Sprite Movement: The first assignment focused on comprehending the provided codebase and implementing sprite movement within a generated window, moving randomly.
+ Simple Game Creation: We developed a basic game using object-oriented programming principles, ensuring all planned features were integrated.
+ Entity Component Architecture: In the third assignment, We reorganized the game codebase to adhere to an Entity Component architecture, enhancing modularity and scalability.
+ Big Array ECS Architecture: We took a further step by adopting the Big Array version of Entity Component System architecture, optimizing performance and memory usage.
+ Game Programming Patterns: The final assignment, serving as the main submission, tasked them with implementing numerous game programming patterns within the game. They collaborated to cover a wide range of patterns, excluding the sparse array pattern.
